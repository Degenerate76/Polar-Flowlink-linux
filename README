* Supported OS

GNU/Linux

* How to compile

in command line run: make

* Requirements: 

libusb-dev

* Inclusion of files from other authors

Part of package includes hidapi project. I have to read some documents on how to include files from other project and not violating GPL. I have definitely violated it unintentinally. This problem has to be solved before I go public.
